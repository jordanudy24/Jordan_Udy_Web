 <h1 style="text-align: left;">Why do I admire him?</h1>
 <p>Muhammad Ali <strong>inspires</strong>me for three main reasons.</p>
 <ol>
     <li>His work habits</li>
     <li>His confidence</li>
     <li>His determination</li>
     </ol>
     <h3><strong>His work habits</strong></h3>
     <p>Muhammad Ali was an amazing athlete who needed to maintain great shape and great physical condition so that he could out work all of his oppents.<br>
     I use his ways to motivate myslef when I am doing sports so that no one on the field will out work me.</p>
     
     <h3><strong>His confidence</strong></h3>
     <p>Though Muhammads career,He was doubted constantly. He used this to work harder so that he could prove all whom hated him wrong.
     <br>I felt inspired by this and I try to use the same method he used in my life. Especially in races or something to do with running. 
     <br>When someome doubts me or says negative things about my abilites before a running situation.<br>I use this as fuel and encouragement to prove them wrong just like Muhammad</p>
     <h3><strong>His determination</strong></h3>
     <p>Just like his habits and confidence,Muhammad was determind to be the best at <em>his</em>sport. No matter what or who tried to stop him.<br>
     Muhammad was the best and everyone knew that for a fact.</p>
