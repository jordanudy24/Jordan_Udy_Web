    <h3>Top 3 Used Guns</h3>
    <li>The three most used guns are the:

        <ul><strong>-ACR</strong>(This assult rifle was by far the best in the game as it was easy to use and it had amazing qualities such as. The lazerbeam accuracy it had as well as the fire rate and damage. This gun was just very good at all distances
            but exclled at medium to long range gun fights). </ul>
        <ul><strong>-MP7</strong>(The MP7 was an amazing sub machine gun. The extremely high fire rate with very low recoil made this gun shred through people at close to medium range gun fights.) </ul>
        <ul><strong>-UMP-45</strong>(The UMP-45 is also a great sub machine gun but having different qualities. For example it fires a little slower however it makes up for that with its damage output. Suprisingly this gun can also take out foes at longer
            distances because of its damage along with low recoil). </ul>

        <img src="../images/guns/mw3_ump.png" alt="Cod" width="500px" class=bo2_m>
</div>
        <h3>Most Overpowered Perk</h3>
        <li>SitRep Pro was by far the most overpowered perk</li>
        <ul>The Pro version makes enemy footsteps four times louder and makes the player and their teammates' footsteps four times quieter, allowing the player to better distinguish enemy movements, and from much further away than normal. This can be particularly
            useful for snipers, allowing them to locate targets approaching from all directions and giving enough time to switch to a secondary weapon.</ul>
        <h3>The Three Best Maps</h3>
        <li>The three most popular maps are:</li>

        <ul><strong>-Dome</strong>(Dome was a very small map in the desert. The close quarters and narrow hallways made this map very intense similar to the nuketown map in black ops games. Shotguns and sub machine guns are best for this map due to all the
            close range gun fights).</ul>
        <ul><strong>-Hardhat</strong>(With the intesting concept of having a map based in a contruction site, hardhat is also a great map because of the long lines of sight dowm different tunnls as well as the shorter lines of sight in different buildings.
            All guns work very well on this map depending on how you play the map. Whether that be rushing or posting up behind cover. )</ul>
        <ul><strong>-Terminal</strong>(A remake of the Modern Warfare 2's map, terminal. Was a great map for many reasons. The fact that the map was located in an airport and you were able to climb on top of the main airplane was very nice for picking people
            off across the map. Inside the buliding, there was lots of cover in which) players could look down longs lines of sight in order to pick people off at the other side of the building. Snipers as well as assult rifles work especially well on
            this map.</ul>

        <h3>Best Killstreaks</h3>
        <li>A few of the best killstreaks include:

            <ul><strong>-AC-130</strong>(The gunship is armed with a 105mm cannon, with a very wide blast radius, but it must reload after each shot and has a long reload phase. It has the widest view in the Gunship, making it good for spotting ground targets.
                The 40mm Bofors auto-cannon creates small explosions and is fully automatic. The 25mm Gatling gun is an automatic rapid-fire weapon with the highest zoom and least splash damage, making it very useful when friendlies and enemies are close
                to each other. The 40mm Bofors and 25mm Gatling gun have unlimited ammunition and do not reload like the 105mm cannon.)</ul>
            <ul><strong>-Reaper</strong>(The Reaper UAV allows the user to spot targets from the air, and launch missiles at them. The player can launch fourteen missiles of similar power to the Predator Missile, but unlike the Predator Missile the Reaper's
                missiles will be laser-guided from the Reaper's camera, as opposed to an on-board missile camera, allowing it to easily hit moving targets or targets behind cover. After firing a counter appears which shows the height of the missile making
                it easier to see when the rocket will hit the ground. The player can zoom in and get a better view on the map by pressing the ADS button.)</ul>
            <ul><strong>-Nuke</strong>(The MOAB (Mother of All Bombs) is a hidden killstreak available with any Strike Package. It's earned by getting a 25 killstreak, not including Strike Package kills. The MOAB works pretty much like the Tactical Nuke from
                Modern Warfare 2; it kills every enemy on the map and causes an EMP-effect for the enemy team by eliminating all enemy equipment, electronics and killstreaks for 1 minute.)</ul>
