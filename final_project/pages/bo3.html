    <h2> Shadows of Evil</h2>
    <h3>Information</h3>


    <p>-This map has a new feature that allows players to become beasts. To do this, interact with a stone basin emitting purple flames. While in beast mode you can grapple onto eagle heads above the map, fire electricity to enable various machines, and
        melee attack to break open sealed door and crates This map will seem very complex until you play it several times. Everyone starts out in a small alley called Easy Street. The area passed Easy Street is called Junction. Junction connects to three
        separate Districts: Canal, Waterfront, and Footlight. Almost every gate has a name above it telling you which district you're entering. All three districts are split into three sections by gates: One section connects to Junction, one section connects
        to the monorail platform, and one section is the high street which can only be reached near the monorail platform by foot or by grappling to eagle heads while in beast mode.</p>
        

    <h3>Pack-a-Punch</h3>
    <p>-The Pack-a-Punch Machine allows weapons to be upgraded into better versions of themselves. The machine typically changes the weapon's name and adds one or more attachments, often including FMJ and Extended Mags in appearance. It also increases the
        pitch of the firing sound and changes the color of the muzzle flash to red or purple. The weapon also notably gains a bizarre camouflage to accent the changes done to it. There is a new feature that affects Pack-a-Punched weapons, where a player
        can upgrade the weapon again after the weapon's first upgrade (for 2500 without ammo being refilled) to gain a perk on the weapon which gives bullets a chance to have a special effect. The perks are as follows:<br> <strong>-Thunder
        Wall:</strong> Random bullets have a Thunder Gun like effect, blasting back zombies.<br> <strong>-Blast Furnace: </strong> Zombies affected by this perk explode when hit; the perk can chain to other zombies.<br> <strong>-Fireworks:</strong> Zombies
        killed have a chance to briefly spawn a cluster of fireworks which kill nearby zombies.<br> <strong>-Turned:</strong> Zombies affected by this perk become "friendly" and will run around attacking other zombies, killing them in one hit.<br> <strong>-Dead Wire:</strong>        Random bullets shock zombies, chaining electricity to nearby zombies similarly to the</p>

    <h3>The Beast</h3>
    <p>-There is one Beast pedestal per area of the map, except for the ends of the Canal and Waterfront districts which have two. The Beast effect can be used once per round in co-op (the player starts with three when playing solo), and lasts for approximately
        30 seconds, signified by the icon on the bottom of the screen turning blue. While the Beast is active, the player is able to send electric shocks that paralyze zombies for a short amount of time and can be used to power up power switches. The
        Beast also has a "grab" and "melee" attack that will kill zombies in one hit. Each of the actions, shock, grab, or melee, reduce the timer by a small amount. It is worth noting zombies killed by the Beast do not give the player points. The shock
        attack can be charged and released to produce an electrical chain on zombies. The player can pick up power ups while in beast mode.</p>

    <h3>Perks</h3>
    In the map Shadows of Evil, There are a variety of perks a player can pick from. The perks include: Juggernog, Quick Revive, Speed Cola, Double Tap Root Beer, Stamin-Up, Mule Kick, Widow's Wine.<br>
    <p><strong>Juggernog:</strong>Without Juggernog, two hits from a regular zombie will down the player, but with Juggernog this increases to five hits. In Black Ops III, the health without Juggernog was increased to three hits, however, with Juggernog,
        the player goes down in six hits making the perk more useful. As Jumping Jacks and Hellhounds deal slightly less damage, seven hits from the former and six hits from the latter will down a player with Juggernog. The player can also be struck by
        electricity four times before downing. The time in the lava is increased up to ten seconds before downing and players can hold their breath longer underwater. This perk costs 2500 points to buy. Players should be careful while purchasing it with
        zombies after them as its effects are not added until the Juggernog icon is seen on the screen, which means they can go down in two hits while drinking the perk, causing them to essentially waste the required 2500 points. Juggernog allows players
        to comfortably spend more time in vulnerable situations such as reloading and drinking other Perk-a-Colas (as the player cannot shoot or sprint during these situations), and gives much more room for mistakes, allowing the player to live longer.
        The color of this perk is red, and the icon is a white cross with a red bullet crossing through it. </p>
    <p><strong>Quick Revive:</strong>Quick Revive, sometimes known as Revive Soda or Revive. It makes the player revive teammates twice as fast or allows the player to revive themselves (only applies when playing solo, except on World at War). Quick Revive
        costs 1500 points in co-op and 500 points in solo games from Call of Duty: Black Ops onward. Due to the lack of teammates in solo, this perk in Call of Duty: World at War is useless, and players are advised to never purchase it. The color for
        this perk is light blue, and the icon is a grave with a man standing up from it.

    </p>
    <p><strong>Speed Cola:</strong>Speed Cola is similar to the multiplayer perk Sleight of Hand, mirroring its effect of decreasing the time it takes to reload by 50%. Additionally, it will greatly increase the rate at which barriers are rebuilt. (barrier
        rebuild speed is not affected by the Call of Duty: Black Ops II variant of this perk). On the map Moon, it also speeds up the hacking speed for the Hacker.Speed Cola costs 3000 points, making it the third most expensive Perk-a-Cola behind Mule
        Kick and Widow's Wine. Its effect is most useful and noticeable on weapons with slow reload times, such as light machine guns, shotguns, and some wonder weapons, but due to its high cost, it is ill-advised to purchase without Juggernog unless
        in dire need. The vending machine from which Speed Cola is purchased has a green and white color scheme. The color for this perk is green, and the icon is a hand holding a weapon magazine, similar to the Sleight of Hand perk.</p>
    <p><strong>Double Tap Root Beer:</strong>Double Tap increases the rate of fire (and recoil accordingly) of all weapons by 33% and doubles bullet damage (2.0 version only). It also allows the player to lay down equipment such as Claymores faster and makes
        players operate bolt-action rifles, pump-action shotguns (as well as re-chambering them), and Wonder Weapons such as the Wrath of the Ancients noticeably quicker, as well as raising the firecap.</p>
    <p><strong>Stamin-Up:</strong> Stamin-Up has two effects, one which is the standard version of the perk Marathon from multiplayer, which gives the player twice the amount of sprint endurance. The other effect is identical to the perk Lightweight from
        multiplayer, giving a 7% speed increase. The color for this perk is yellow, and the icon is a man running at a high speed. The perk costs 2000 points. It is most useful when the player will be running around the map as part of their strategy,
        or if they are in danger and being chased by a massive horde of zombies or have to rush to revive a teammate in time.</p>
    <p><strong>Mule Kick:</strong>Mule Kick is a Perk-a-Cola that is featured in the game mode Zombies and Cyborg Rising. It was introduced in the Call of Duty: Black Ops Zombies map Moon. It allows the player to hold three weapons at once. It costs 4000
        points to purchase, making it tied with Widow's Wine for the most expensive Perk-a-Cola. When purchased, the player will not see any effect except for the symbol appearing on their HUD. When the player goes to buy their next weapon, the prompt
        will still state that taking it will replace the currently selected weapon, but in reality it will take its place in the third slot. The color of this perk is dark green (although the color of the drink is dark red) and the icon is three pistols,
        one behind the other from bottom to top.</p>
    <p><strong>Widow's Wine:</strong>Widow's Wine gives the player a special type of grenade similar to the Semtex which creates a spider web when it detonates, as well as increasing melee damage, changing the sound for the default knife, adding a green
        trail to the default knife, and causing melee attacks to have a random chance to ensnare zombies without consuming grenade ammo. The web slows zombies down momentarily and deals some damage to the zombies, but none to the player. The player will
        automatically detonate the grenades in their pocket when hurt by zombies, enabling them to make a quick escape when they would normally be cornered. It is important to note that being slapped by zombies will cause the player's Widow's Wine Grenade
        ammo to deplete without throwing one, and can also kill the last zombie of a round if they are trying to keep it alive. In this situation, it is preferable to throw all remaining grenades out of map to avoid accidentally detonating them. The player
        can replenish grenades all at once with a Max Ammo, two at a time by starting a new round similarly to frag grenades and Semtexes, or one at a time by killing zombies ensnared in a web, which have a random chance of creating a blue drop that looks
        like the spider on the perk icon. It is possible to melee zombies in an attempt to ensnare them and kill them for additional grenades without consuming any, or when the player is out of them.</p>
