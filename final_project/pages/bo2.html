    <h3>Top 3 Used Guns</h3>
    <li>The three most used guns are the:

        <ul><strong>-M8A1</strong>(The M8A1 is a 4 round burst assult rifle with a high fire rate. This weapon is the most used gun in the game because of how quick it's kill time is. If the user stays at a medium distance from thier ememies, there is a very
            slim chance that the user will get out guned.) </ul>
        <ul><strong>-An-94</strong>(Out of all the fully automatic assult rifles, the An-94 is definetely the best. With this weapon, the first two bullets that you shoot, shoot a lot faster than the rest making this gun a good challange to sub machine guns
            close range. On top of that, the An-94 is a great choice for medium range gun fights because of how easy the recoil is to control) </ul>
        <ul><strong>-MSMC</strong>(Being the best sub machine gun in the game, the MSMC is great for many reasons. To start, The firerate which is very moderate along with the high damage it comes with makes this guns kill time very quick. Also the clip size
            of this gun combined with the damage output makes it so you don't have to reload after every kill which is nice when in intense situations.) </ul>

        <h3>Most Overpowered Perk</h3>
        <li>Awareness was the most used and overpowered perk in the game.</li>
        <ul>-What awareness allowed was that the user could hear any in game sound so much clearer and from far away. This could be equipment like shockchargers that give a static sound to even enemy player footsteps. The reason why this was so overpowered
            was that users used this perk while sitting still waiting for an enemy to come near. Since the user can hear them, they waited for the right opprotunity to attack and most of the time kill.</ul>
        <h3>The Three Best Maps</h3>
        <li>The three most popular maps are:</li>

        <ul><strong>-Nuketown</strong>(Nuketown is by far the smallest out of all the maps. Which players find great because that allows for constant action. While sometimes stressful because of the constant action, Nuketown will go down to be one of the
            best maps in history)</ul>
        <ul><strong>-Raid</strong>(Raid takes place on a mansion property. In the map it includes:a basketball court, a safe house, two pools, a zen garden and an art house. This map is has a very cool design and the size of the map makes it so ther is action
            all the time. The lines of sight along with the angles of the map make it so you have to play this map very strategically)</ul>
        <ul><strong>-Highjacked</strong>(Highjacked is a map based on a cruise ship. This is one of the only maps that challange Nuketown for how small and close quarters it is. Sub machine guns rule this map as an enemy is almost always close to you. The
            fact that you can rush under the boat to get behind enemy lines make this map so much harder to play as enemies are going to be behind you as well as infront of you.)</ul>

        <h3>Best Killstreaks</h3>
        <li>A few of the best killstreaks include:</li>
        <ul><strong>-Orbital</strong>(For 12 kills in a row you can get the Blackbird. What this killstreak does is that it lights up all the enemies on you and your teamates radar. As well as lighting them up, it also tells you what way they are facing so
            that you are able to sneak up on them in order to continue your streak.)</ul>
        <ul><strong>-V-Tol Warship</strong>(For 17 kills in a row, you get to control a flying warship. On the killstreak you have the option to shoot minigun ammunition or missles at the enemies making it an amazing streak.)</ul>
        <ul><strong>-Swarm</strong>(The hardest killstreak to get in the game, you can get the swarm for 19 kills in a row. This killstreak calls in hundreds of drones that dive down and explode on contact with the enemies.)</ul>
