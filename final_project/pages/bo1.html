<h3>Top 3 Used Guns</h3>
<li>The three most used guns are the:

<ul><strong>-Famas</strong> (The incredible firerate, as well as the damage that the assult rifle comes with, makes this weapon very useful for close to medium range gun fights).</ul> 
<ul><strong>-AK74u</strong> (Easily the best sub-machine gun in the game, the high power, low recoil gives this weapon an upper edge in nearly all of it's gun fights.)</ul> 
<ul><strong>-Galil</strong> (The Galil is an amazing assult rifle for medium to long range encounters.The high firerate along with the low recoil allows its users to pick off enemies in the distance).</ul>

<h3>Most Overpowered Perk</h3>
<li>Ghost was by far the most overpowered perk</li>
<ul>-Ghost allowed the users who picked to use it, protection from the radar that other users can see. Once used enough, you can unlock "Ghost Pro". This was even more unfair then the original perk. With this unlock, you are immune to the radar from anything that could put you on the radar such as: radar scanner, uav, blackbird, etc.</ul>
<h3>Most Popular Maps</h3>
<li>The three most popular maps are:

<ul><strong>-Nuketown</strong> (Nuketown is by far the smallest out of all the maps. Which players find great because that allows for constant action. While sometimes stressful because of the constant action, Nuketown will go down to be one of the best maps in history).</ul> 
<ul><strong>-Firing Range</strong> (Based in a military training base, Firing Range is simialr to Nuketown becase its small size. Furthermore, this map gives great coverage as well as great lines of sight that would lead to interesting gun fights.)</ul> 
<ul><strong>-Jungle</strong> (Like the name of the map states, Jungle is a large map that is suited for long range gun fights. However, This map also has sneaky pathways that are used for great rushes. This map has an amazing balance of both short to long range gun fights making it fit into the top three list).</ul>

<h3>Best Killstreaks</h3>
<li>A few of the best killstreaks include:

<ul><strong>-Blackbird</strong> (For 8 kills in a row you can get the Blackbird. What this killstreak does is that it lights up all the enemies on you and your teamates radar. As well as lighting them up, it also tells you what way they are facing so that you are able to sneak up on them in order to continue your streak.).</ul> 
<ul><strong>-Chopper Gunner</strong> (Unlocking the Chopper Gunner at 9 kills, you are able to control the machine gun turrent that is on a helicopter. You get roughly a minute to do as much damage and get as many kills as you can.)</ul> 
<ul><strong>-Attack Dogs</strong> (After getting 11 kills, you are able to call in attack dogs. Many dogs enter the map getting you even more kils as you are running around the map looking for people as they hide from your dogs).</ul>
