    <h3>Top 3 Used Guns</h3>
    <li>The three most used guns are the:

        <ul><strong>-The Ripper</strong>(This weapon is really quite overpowered. You have an smg with a very high fire rate and controllable recoil, and then you can switch to an assault rifle for longer ranges instantaneously (yes, proven to have a 0.00
            second change time). This means the Ripper has 2x the versitality of any other weapon in the game, as it can handle two times as many engagements, if not more. While neither the SMG or AR forms of the weapon are particularly the best of its
            respective class (although this can be argued) they are both more than good enough to get most jobs done). </ul>
        <ul><strong>-honey badger</strong>(In Ghosts, a silenced weapon is very deadly. With the wide-open maps, an assault rifle does much better than an SMG, which is opposite of Black ops 2. The Honey Badger is an assault rifle, which has an integrated
            Silencer. This gives you room in your attachments for a fore grip, plus whatever floats your boat.) </ul>
        <ul><strong>-Remington R5</strong>(The Remington R5 is amazing since it is both powerful and accurate. Long distance engagements even against opposing snipers can be won with a Remington since it's so steady when firing, and kills in usually 3 hits.
            And if your worried about the smaller mag capacity, don't be. The higher damage per round makes up for a little less ammo, and on top of that the reduced fire rate aids in limiting ammo consumption. This weapon is extremely useful when mastered,
            and is best in the hands of those who prefer accurate and reliable fire over spray and prey. ) </ul>

        <h3>Most Overpowered Perk</h3>
        <li>Focus was an important perk to have on all classes</li>
        <ul>- perk that is essential for all classes in Call of Duty: Ghosts is Focus. It reduces flinching which is often the reason you lose a contested engagement. Even on shotguns, where you usually should fire from the hip, Focus is important</ul>
        <h3>The Three Best Maps</h3>
        <li>The three most popular maps are:</li>

        <ul><strong>-Warhawk</strong>(Warhawk is a diverse map supporting many different styles of play. Medium-to-long range engagements are frequent in the main road, as players must watch all openings from which opponents can emerge, including the three
            second-story windows overlooking the map. These three second-story spots allow for a player with a sniper rifle, marksman rifle, or LMG to quickly dominate by picking off people in the street. One of these such outposts has only one entrance
            and provides a view of almost the entire street, making it a popular location.Away from the main road, however, play becomes much more close-range. A player with a SMG or an assault rifle easily dominates the back streets).</ul>
        <ul><strong>-Strikezone</strong>(Strikezone is one of the smaller maps in the game, and as such supports much more close-range combat than other maps due to large amounts of cover and alternative routes. The player will find almost no long-range engagements,
            so certain weapons will be disadvantaged. These include the LMGs (due to the slower movement speed on a very fast-paced map) and sniper rifles (unless the player likes to quickscope). Medium range weapons do well in the many corridor areas
            on the map, like the AK-12. Shotguns allow a skilled player to navigate all the tight corners in this map without fear of dying, as any shotgun can dispatch an enemy at point-blank range. However, shotgunners should stay away from more open
            areas where SMGs and assault rifles will easily mow them down. An assault rifle or SMG with a high rate of fire should be chosen over one with a low rate of fire and high damage, due to the fact that a lower rate of fire will cause an enemy
            to flinch less at short range, increasing the chance of them killing the player).</ul>
        <ul><strong>-Favela</strong>(Favela, a multi-tiered map set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. This map features fast paced and close quarters battles. It has many tall buildings for snipers and alleys for close quarters. Much of the map is built vertically
            with plenty of space around the rooftops and two-story buildings. There is a soccer field where the battles are mostly held. This map can accommodate many different styles of play and gametypes.)</ul>

        </div>
        <h3>Best Killstreaks</h3>
        <li>A few of the best killstreaks include:


            <ul><strong>-Maniac</strong>(A Care Package is airdropped into the map that holds the killstreak. Once picked up, you get the Juggernaut armor and a throwing knife - nothing more. Unlike the normal Juggernaut killstreak, this version allows you
                to move extremely fast, but your health doesn't regenerate).</ul>
            <ul><strong>-Trinity Rocket</strong>(For 7 kills you can get a remote-controlled missile similar to the Predator Missile from MW3. You can also fire smart drone projectiles while controlling the Trinity Rocket to the ground).</ul>
            <ul><strong>-Helo Pilot</strong>(Allows you to control an AAS-72X Attack Helicopter for a short period of time. The AAS-72X comes with a minigun and flares).</ul>
